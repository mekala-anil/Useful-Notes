Maven is a Automation Build Tool used primarly for Java Projects

Main aspects of Maven is two

1. Dependency Management

2. Project Build life cycle management

Maven is based on Project Object Model (pom.xml)


Maven Life Cycle:

Its a sequence of phases which executes one by one

compile --> test --> package --> install --> deploy

Maven has 3 life cycles

1. site: creates website with information about our project
	
	mvn site

	-Inside targest/site index.html

2. clean: removes /target folder from project

3. default: main life cycle consists of more than 20 phases

- We can write multiple commands in single line

Maven Goals:
-------------

1. Compile Goals

	mvn compile: Compiles source code of Project (located in src/main/java)

	mvn test-compile: Compiles test source code (src/test/java)

2. Test Goals

	mvn test: Executes unit tests using compiled files, it requires mvn compile or mvn test-compile

	mvn integration-test: Executes Integration tests

3. Packing Goals

	mvn package: Packages compiled code into distributable format jar/war/ear

	mvn install: Install the package into local maven repositary, makes artifact available for other 

	projects

4. Clean Goals

	mvn clean: Deletes files created by previous build

5. Deploy Goals

	mvn deploy: Deploys artifact to a remote repositary e.g. maven central or internal nexus repositary

6. Validate Goals
