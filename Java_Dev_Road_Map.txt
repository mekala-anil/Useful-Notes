Java Developer Road Map:
------------------------

-> Java Basics

	*Go deep into every topic and Understand Concepts

	Variables/DataTypes
	Conditional Statements
	Loops
	Arrays and Strings
	Exceptional Handling 
	
	OOPs and Collections:
	
	Four Pillars of OOps
	Generics
	Collection Framework
	Comparable & Comparator
	Lamda & Streams

-> Problem Solving (DSA) 

	Complete DSA (GFG self paced )

-> Spring Boot

	Dependency Injection and Management
	Maven & Gradle
	Hibernate
	Build REST APIs
	TDD (test driven development) and JUnit
	Build Projects

-> Additional Tools

	Git and GitHub
	Linux (Basic Commands)
	AWS SQS, Lamda, Dynamo DB, EC2 etc.
	IntelliJ (Recommanded over Eclipse)
	Jenkins
	Design Principles and SOA
	Microservices, Docker and Kubernetes
