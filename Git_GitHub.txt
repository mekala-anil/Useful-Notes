Q. What is Git

	Git is a Verson Control Tool, which is used to track changes in code

	and it allows to collabarate with teams

Q. What is GitHub

	GitHub is a website where developers can store and manage their code using Git

	https://github.com

	We will store in Repositories



Initial commit : first change

commit: final change

commits will be saved in the form of history

README.md : Markdown file which will help to describe about project or repo


ls: will list out available directories
pwd: will show current working directory


Configuring Git:
---------------

We can configure git globally and locally but recommanded to go globally

To configure globally

git config --global user.name "mekala-anil"

git config --global user.email "anil.mekala1768@gmail.com"

git config --list : It will show configured credentials


Clone and Status:
-----------------

Clone : Cloning a repository on your local machine from remote github repo

	git clone <somelink>

status: displays state of code with respect to github repo

	git status

we have 4 types in status

	1. untracked : new files that git not yet tracked

	2. modified : changed file

	3. staged : file is ready to be commited (add)

	4. unmodified : no changes



Add & Commit:
-------------

	add : adds new or changed files in your working directory to git staging area

		git add <filename> : adds specific file to git statging area

		git add . : adds all changed files to git staging area


		all files in staging area are ready to be commited

	commit : it is the record of change

		git commit -m "any commit message"

		it will commit changes to remote repo but it will not show changes in remote repo untill we do git push


push : uploads local repo to remote repo

	git push origin main


	origin : from where we cloned
	main : directly to main branch

	after this code changes will be visibile in remote repo


Init Command:
------------

	git init : It will initialize local folder as git repo

	git remote add origin <somelink> : It will connect new local repo with remote repo

	git remote -v : To verify remote

	git branch : checks which branch we are in

	git branch -M main : To rename branch

	git push origin main : It will push code to remote repo

	git push -u origin main : It will set upstream, no need to use origin main again and again and next time
								we can use short form 'git push' to push under same repo


Branch Commands:
---------------

	git branch : To check in which branch we are

	git branch -M main : To rename branch to main

	git checkout <branchname> : to change to any branch (navigate)

	git checkout -b <new branch name> : it will create new branch

	git checkout -d <branch name> : It will delete the branch


Merging Code:
-------------

	option 1

	git diff <branch name> : It will compare current branch with given branch

	git merge <branch name> : it will merge two branches


	option 2

	Create a PR (Pull Request)


Pull Request:

	It tells others about changes you have pushed to a branch in a repository in github


Pull Command: used to fetch and download content from a remote repo and immediately update local repo
				to match content

				it will pull from remote repo and integrate with local repo if any changes made in remote repo

	git pull origin main




Merge Conflicts:
---------------

	An event that takes place when git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits

	We Need to choose manually which change we want


Undoing Changes:
----------------

	case 1: staged changes (not commited yet)

		git reset <filename>

		git reset


	case 2: Commited changes (for one commit)

		git reset HEAD~1 : it set back to staging, just before commit

	case 3: Commited changes (for many commits)

		git reset <commit hash>

		git reset --hard <commit hash> : It will reflect in VS Code as well



git logs : Will show all logs og git


Fork:
-----

	Fork is Copy of original repository that allows you to do any changes in code and that
	will not effect original repo




git remote remove origin : To disconnect local repo from romte repo

git push -all : To push all at a time


- In summary, cloning is used to create a local copy of a remote repository, while pulling is used to update your local repository with changes from the remote repository. Both operations are essential for collaborating with others and keeping your local repository synchronized with the latest changes.

________________________________
To update local copy with remote

git checkout my-feature-branch   # Step 1: Switch to the feature branch
git fetch origin                 # Step 2: Fetch latest changes
git merge origin/main            # Step 3: Merge updates from the remote main branch
# OR
git rebase origin/main           # Step 3: (Alternative) Rebase with the remote main branch
git push origin my-feature-branch # Step 5: Push changes back to remote
