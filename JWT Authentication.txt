								JWT Authentication
								------------------


	JWT Authentication is open, industry standard for representing claims securely between two parties

	- It will contain User Details and Autherizations


	JWT Token contains


	1. Header
		- Type:JWT
		- Hashing Algorithm:HS512

	2. Payload
		-Standard Attributes
			iss:The issuer
			sub:The subject
			aud:The audience
			exp: when does token expires
			iat: when was token issued
		-Custom Attributes
			youratt1:your attribute

	3. Signature
		-Includes Secret


- Symmetric Algorithms use same key for encryption and decryption

- Asymmetric Algorithms use public key for encryption and private key for decryption


Understanding JWT Flow:
-----------------------

1. Create a JWT
	-Needs Encoding
		a.User credentials
		b.User data(Payload)
		c.RSA key pair

2. Send JWT as part of request header
	- Autherization Header
	- Bearer Token
	- Autherization:Bearer ${JWT_Token}

3. JWT Verified
	- Needs Decoding
	- RSA Key pair(public key)
