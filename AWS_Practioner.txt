Types of Cloud Computing:

	Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS): Complete Virtual Machine (A OS machine in cloud)

	Platform as a Service(PaaS) : Directly Deploy without worrying about underlying software

	Softaware as a Service(SaaS) : complete software runs and managed by AWS


- AWS as pay as as you go pricing model, which has majorly 3 categories

1. Compute: Pay for compute time
2. Storage: Pay for data stored
3. Networking: Pay for OUT transferred data, Data transfer IN is free


IAM: Users & Groups
--------------------

IAM: Identity and Access Management

-It is a Global Service

-Root account created by default, it can't be used or shared

-Users and Groups can be created

-Groups only contain Users, not groups

-User can be alone or User can belong to multiple groups


IAM:Permissions:
----------------

-Users or Groups are assigned by JSON Documents which are Policies

-Theses policies define users to use resources

-In AWS we will give least privilages to users or groups, not more than needed



To Access AWS:
--------------

To access AWS we have 3 options

1. AWS Management Console : Protected by Password + MFA

2. AWS Command Line Interface(CLI): Protected by access keys

3. AWS Software Development Kits(SDK): for code:protected by access keys

-Access Keys are generated throw AWS Console


AWS CLI:
---------

A tool that enables you to interact with AWS Services using commands in your command line shell

-Direct Access to Public APIs of AWS services

-You can develop scripts to manage your resources

-Alternative to use AWS Management Console


AWS SDK
-------

AWSSoftware Development Kit(AWS SDK)

-Language specific APIs(set of libraries)

-Enables you to manage and access aws services programatically

-Embedded within your application

-Supports many programming languages

-AWS CLI built on AWS SDK for Python


IAM Roles for Services
-----------------------

-Some AWS Services will need to perform actions on your behalf

-To do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services with IAM Roles

-Common Roles

	EC2 Instance Roles

	Lamda Function Roles

	Roles for CloudFormation



IAM Security Tools:
-------------------

IAM Credentials Report(acoount-level)

	-A Report that lists all your account users and status of their various credentials

IAM Access Advisor(user-level)

	-Shows service permissions granted to a user and when those services last accessed



Amazon EC2(Elastic Cloud Compute)
----------------------------------

-EC2 is one of the most papulor AWS offering

-It is Inftrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

-Main Capabilities are

	-Renting Virtual Machines(EC2)

	-Storing data on Virtual Drives(EBS)

	-Distributing load across machines(ELB)

	-Scaling services using Auto Scaling Groups(ASG)

-Knowing EC2 is fundamental to know how cloud works


EC2 Configuration Options:
--------------------------

-Operating Systems(OS): Windows, Linux, Mac OS

-How much compute power and cores(CPU)

-How much random access memory(RAM)

-How much storage space

	-Network Attached(EBS & EFS)

	-Hardware(EC2 Instance Store)

-Network card: Speed of card, Public IP Address

-Firewall Rules: Security Groups

-Bootstrap script(At first launch): User Data

-We have Several Instance types to choose based on requirements


Security Groups:
----------------

-Security Groups are fundamentals of network security in AWS

-They controll how traffic allowed INTO or OUT of EC2 Instances

-Security Groups only contain Allow rules

-Security group rules can reference by IP or by Security groups

-They regulate access to ports

-They regulate authorized IP ranges- IPv4 and IPv6

-Security group can be attached to multiple instances and vice versa

-By default, all inbound traffic blocked and outbound traffic autherized


Classic Ports to Know:
----------------------

22=SSH(Secure Shell)-log in into linux instance

21=FTP(File Transfer Protocal)-upload files into file share

22=SFTP(Secure File transfer Protocal)-upload files using SSH

80=HTTP-access unsecured websites

443=HTTPS-access secured websites

3389=RDP(Remote Desktop Protocal)-log into a windows instance
